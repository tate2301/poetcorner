Ask the Wright brothers,

Persistent men will reach the skys.

Am I right brothers?

Predecessors told us the sky is the limit,

Well go for it, aim to

shine and live among the stars

I didn’t say work for the cars

But rather work for a great legacy

Be the one to inspire,

Be the change you desire.

Attitude is but an attire,

You choose the one you want to put on.

Take the risk and remember;

The Daring Will Fly.
